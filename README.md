# Quick Setup

We're going to use `vim-plug` to install vim-go. Feel free to use other plugin
managers instead. We will create a minimal `~/.vimrc`, and add to it as we go along.

First fetch and install `vim-plug` along with `vim-go`:

```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git ~/.vim/plugged/vim-go
```

Create `~/.vimrc` with following content:

```vim
call plug#begin()
Plug 'fatih/vim-go'
call plug#end()
```

And finally be sure to install all necessary Go tools (such as guru, goimports,
gocode, etc...). If you already have them in your PATH, you're good to go.

```
vim -c "GoInstallBinaries" -c "qa" 
```

Or open Vim and execute `:GoInstallBinaries`. This is a `vim-go` command that
installs all `vim-go` dependencies for you. It doesn't download pre compiled
binaries, instead it calls `go get` under the hood, so the binaries are all
compiled in your host machine (which is both safe and simplifies the
installation process as we don't need to provide binaries for multiple
platforms). If you already have some of the dependencies (such as `guru`,
`goimports`) call `:GoUpdateBinaries` to update the binaries. 

For the tutorial, all our examples will be under
`GOPATH/src/github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial/`. Please be sure you're inside
this folder. If you already have a `GOPATH` set up just execute:
```
go get github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial
```
This will create the folder needed and will make it easy to follow the
tutorial. If you do create this folder manually then the above command will not work, but that shouldn't stop you 
because you can enter the contents of the example in vim.


# Hello World!

Open the `main.go` file from your terminal:

```
vim main.go
```

It's a very basic file that prints `vim-go` to stdout.

# Run it

You can easily run the file with `:GoRun`. Under the hood it calls `go run` for
the current file. You should see that it prints `vim-go`.

# Build it

Replace `vim-go` with `Hello Gophercon`. Let us compile the file instead of running it.
For this we have `:GoBuild`. If you call it, you should see this message: 

```
vim-go: [build] SUCCESS
```

Under the hood it calls `go build`, but it's a bit smarter. It does a couple of
things differently: 

* No binaries are created; you can call `:GoBuild` multiple times without
  polluting your workspace.
* It automatically `cd`s into the source package's directory
* It parses any errors and shows them inside a quickfix list 
* It automatically detects the GOPATH and modifies it if needed (detects
  projects such as `gb`, `Godeps`, etc..)
* Uses [vim-dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch) if installed.
* Runs async if used within NeoVim (coming soon to Vim as well!)

# Fix it

Let's introduce two errors by adding two compile errors:

```go
var b = foo()

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello GopherCon")
	a
}
```

Save the file and call `:GoBuild` again. 

This time the quickfix view will be opened. To jump between the errors you can
use `:cnext` and `:cprevious`. Let us fix the first error, save the
file and call `:GoBuild` again. You'll see the quickfix list is updated with a
single error. Remove the second error as well, save the file and call
`:GoBuild` again. Now because there are no more errors, vim-go automatically
closes the quickfix window for you.

Let us improve it a little bit. Vim has a setting called `autowrite` that
writes the content of the file automatically if you call `:make`. vim-go also
makes use of this setting. Open your `.vimrc` and add the following:

```
set autowrite
```

Now you don't have to save your file anymore when you call `:GoBuild`.  If we
reintroduce the two errors and call `:GoBuild`, we can now iterate much more
quickly by only calling `:GoBuild`.

`:GoBuild` jumps to the first error encountered. If you don't want to jump
append the `!` (bang) sign: `:GoBuild!`.

In all the `go` commands, such as `:GoRun`, `:GoInstall`, `:GoTest`, etc..,
whenever there is an error the quickfix window always will pop up.

### vimrc improvements

* You can add some shortcuts to make it easier to jump between errors in quickfix
list:

```vi
map <C-n> :cnext<CR>
map <C-m> :cprevious<CR>
nnoremap <leader>a :cclose<CR>
```

* I also use these shortcuts to build and run a Go program with `<leader>b` and
`<leader>r`:

```vim
autocmd FileType go nmap <leader>b  <Plug>(go-build)
autocmd FileType go nmap <leader>r  <Plug>(go-run)
```

* There are two types of error lists in Vim. One is called `location list` the
other `quickfix`. Unfortunately the commands for each lists are different. So
`:cnext` only works for `quickfix` list, for `location lists` you have to use
`:lnext`. Some of the commands in `vim-go` open a location list, because
location lists are associated with a window and each window can have a
separate list. This means you can have multiple windows, and multiple
location lists, one for `Build`, one for `Check`, one for `Tests`, etc..

Some people prefer to use only `quickfix` though. If you add the following to
your `vimrc` all lists will be of type `quickfix`:

```vim
let g:go_list_type = "quickfix"
```

# Test it

Let's write a simple function and a test for the function. Add the following:


```go
func Bar() string {
	return "bar"
}
```

Open a new file called `main_test.go` (it doesn't matter how you open it, from
inside Vim, a separate Vim session, etc.. it's up to you). Let us use the
current buffer and open it from Vim via `:edit main_test.go`.

When you open the new file you notice something. The file automatically has the
package declaration added:

```go
package main
```

This is done by vim-go automatically. It detected that the file is inside a
valid package and therefore created a file based on the package name (in our
case the package name was `main`). If there are no files, vim-go automatically
populates the content with a simple main package.

Update the test file with the following code:

```go
package main

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestBar(t *testing.T) {
	result := Bar()
	if result != "bar" {
		t.Errorf("expecting bar, got %s", result)
	}
}
```

Call `:GoTest`. You'll see the following message:

```
vim-go: [test] PASS
```

`:GoTest` calls `go test` under the hood. It has the same improvements
we have for `:GoBuild`. If there is any test error, a quickfix list is
opened again and you can jump to it easily.

Another small improvement is that you don't have to open the test file itself.
Try it yourself: open `main.go` and call `:GoTest`. You'll see the tests will
be run for you as well.

`:GoTest` times out after 10 seconds by default. This is useful because Vim is
not async by default. You can change the timeout value with `let g:go_test_timeout = '10s'`

We have two more commands that makes it easy to deal with test files. The first
one is `:GoTestFunc`. This only tests the function under your cursor.
Let us change the content of the test file (`main_test.go`) to:

```go
package main

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
	t.Error("intentional error 1")
}

func TestBar(t *testing.T) {
	result := Bar()
	if result != "bar" {
		t.Errorf("expecting bar, got %s", result)
	}
}

func TestQuz(t *testing.T) {
	t.Error("intentional error 2")
}
```

Now when we call `:GoTest` a quickfix window will open with two errors.
However if go inside the `TestBar` function and call `:GoTestFunc`, you'll see
that our test passes!  This is really useful if you have a lot of tests that
take time and you only want to run certain tests.

The other test-related command is `:GoTestCompile`. Tests not only need to
pass with success, they must compile without any problems.
`:GoTestCompile` compiles your test file, just like `:GoBuild` and opens a
quickfix if there are any errors. This however **doesn't run** the tests. This
is very useful if you have a large test which you're editing a lot. Call
`:GoTestCompile` in the current test file, you should see the following:

```
vim-go: [test] SUCCESS 
```

### vimrc improvements

* As with `:GoBuild` we can add a mapping to easily call `:GoTest` with a key
combination. Add the following to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
autocmd FileType go nmap <leader>t  <Plug>(go-test)
```

Now you can easily test your files via `<leader>t`

* Let's make building Go files simpler. First, remove the following mapping we added
  previously:

```vim
autocmd FileType go nmap <leader>b  <Plug>(go-build)
```

We're going to add an improved mapping. To make it seamless for
any Go file we can create a simple Vim function that checks the type of the Go
file, and execute `:GoBuild` or `:GoTestCompile`.  Below is the helper function
you can add to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
" run :GoBuild or :GoTestCompile based on the go file
function! s:build_go_files()
  let l:file = expand('%')
  if l:file =~# '^\f\+_test\.go$'
    call go#cmd#Test(0, 1)
  elseif l:file =~# '^\f\+\.go$'
    call go#cmd#Build(0)
  endif
endfunction

autocmd FileType go nmap <leader>b :<C-u>call <SID>build_go_files()<CR>
```

Now whenever you hit `<leader>b` it'll build either your Go file or it'll
compile your test files seamlessly.

* By default the leader shortcut is defined as: `\` I've mapped my leader to
`,` as I find it more useful with the following setting (put this in the
beginning of .vimrc):

```vim
let mapleader = ","
```

So with this setting, we can easily build any test and non test files with `,b`.

# Cover it

Let's dive further into the world of tests. Tests are really important. Go
has a really great way of showing the coverage of your source code. vim-go
makes it easy to see the code coverage without leaving Vim in a very elegant
way.


Let's first change our `main_test.go` file back to:

```go
package main

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestBar(t *testing.T) {
	result := Bar()
	if result != "bar" {
		t.Errorf("expecting bar, got %s", result)
	}
}
```

And `main.go` to


```go
package main

func Bar() string {
	return "bar"
}

func Foo() string {
	return "foo"
}

func Qux(v string) string {
	if v == "foo" {
		return Foo()
	}

	if v == "bar" {
		return Bar()
	}

	return "INVALID"
}
```

Now let us call `:GoCoverage`. Under the hood this calls `go test -coverprofile
tempfile`. It parses the lines from the profile and then dynamically changes
the syntax of your source code to reflect the coverage. As you see, because we
only have a test for the `Bar()` function, that is the only function that is
green. 

To clear the syntax highlighting you can call `:GoCoverageClear`. Let us add a
test case and see how the coverage changes. Add the following to `main_test.go`
to:

```go
func TestQuz(t *testing.T) {
	result := Qux("bar")
	if result != "bar" {
		t.Errorf("expecting bar, got %s", result)
	}

	result = Qux("qux")
	if result != "INVALID" {
		t.Errorf("expecting INVALID, got %s", result)
	}
}
```

If we call `:GoCoverage` again, you'll see that the `Quz` function is now
tested as well and that it has a larger coverage. Call `:GoCoverageClear` again
to clear the syntax highlighting.

Because calling `:GoCoverage` and `:GoCoverageClear` are used a lot together,
there is another command that makes it easy to call and clear the result. You
can also use `:GoCoverageToggle`. This acts as a toggle and shows the coverage,
and when called again it clears the coverage.  It's up to your workflow how you
want to use them.

Finally, if you don't like vim-go's internal view, you can also call
`:GoCoverageBrowser`. Under the hood it uses `go tool cover` to create a HTML
page and then opens it in your default browser. Some people like this more.

Using the `:GoCoverageXXX` commands do not create any kind of temporary files.
It doesn't pollute your workflow. So you don't have to deal with removing
unwanted files every time.

### vimrc improvements

Add the following to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
autocmd FileType go nmap <Leader>c <Plug>(go-coverage-toggle)
```

With this you can easily call `:GoCoverageToggle` with `<leader>c`


# Edit it

### Imports

Let us start with a sample `main.go` file:

```go
package main

     import "fmt"

func main() {
 fmt.Println("    gophercon"     )
}
```

Let's start with something we know already. If save the file, you'll see that
it'll be formatted automatically. It's enabled by default but can be disabled
if desired (not sure why you would though :)) with `let g:go_fmt_autosave = 0`.
Optionally we also provide `:GoFmt` command, which runs `gofmt` under the hood.

Let's print the `"gophercon"` string in all uppercase. For it we're going to use
the `strings` package. Change the definition to:

```go
fmt.Println(strings.ToLower("Gopher"))
```

When you build it you'll get an error of course:

```
main.go|8| undefined: strings in strings.ToLower
```

You'll see we get an error because the `strings` package is not imported. vim-go
has couple of commands to make it easy to manipulate the import declarations.

We can easily go and edit the file, but instead we're going to use the Vim
command `:GoImport`. This command adds the given package to the import path.
Run it via: `:GoImport strings`. You'll see the `strings` package is being
added.  The great thing about this command is that it also supports
completion. So you can just type `:GoImport s` and hit tab.

We also have `:GoImportAs` and `:GoDrop` to edit the import paths.
`:GoImportAs` is the same as `:GoImport`, but it allows changing the package
name. For example `:GoImportAs str strings`, will import `strings` with the
package name `str.`

Finally `:GoDrop` makes it easy to remove any import paths from the import
declarations. `:GoDrop strings` will remove it from the import declarations.

Of course manipulating import paths is so 2010. We have better tools to handle
this case for us. If you haven't heard yet, it's called `goimports`.
`goimports` is a replacement for `gofmt`. You have two ways of using it. The
first (and recommended) way is telling vim-go to use it when saving the
file:

```
let g:go_fmt_command = "goimports"
```

Now whenever you save your file, `goimports` will automatically format and also
rewrite your import declarations. Some people do not prefer `goimports` as it
might be slow on very large codebases. In this case we also have the
`:GoImports` command (note the `s` at the end). With this, you can explicitly
call `goimports`


### Text objects

Let us show more editing tips/tricks. There are two text objects that we can
use to change functions. Those are `if` and `af`. `if` means inner function and
it allows you to select the content of a function enclosure. Change your `main.go` file to:


```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println(1)
	fmt.Println(2)
	fmt.Println(3)
	fmt.Println(4)
	fmt.Println(5)
}
```

Put your cursor on the `func` keyword  Now execute the following in `normal`
mode and see what happens:

```
dif
```

You'll see that the function body is removed. Because we used the `d` operator.
Undo your changes with `u`. The great thing is that your cursor can be anywhere
starting from the `func` keyword until the closing right brace `}`. It uses the tool
[motion](https://github.com/fatih/motion) under the hood. I wrote motion
explicitly for vim-go to support features like this. It's Go AST aware and thus
its capabilities are really good. Like what you might ask? Change `main.go` to:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Bar() string {
	fmt.Println("calling bar")

	foo := func() string {
		return "foo"
	}

	return foo()
}
```

Previously we were using regexp-based text objects. And it lead to problems.
For example in this example, put your cursor to the anonymous functions' `func`
keyword and execute `dif` in `normal` mode. You'll see that only the body of
the anonymous function is deleted.

We have only used the `d` operator (delete) so far. However it's up to you. For
example you can select it via `vif` or yank(copy) with `yif`.

We also have `af`, which means `a function`. This text object includes the
whole function declaration. Change your `main.go` to:


```go
package main

import "fmt"

// bar returns a the string "foo" even though it's named as "bar". It's an
// example to be used with vim-go's tutorial to show the 'if' and 'af' text
// objects.
func bar() string {
	fmt.Println("calling bar")

	foo := func() string {
		return "foo"
	}

	return foo()
}
```


So here is the great thing. Because of `motion` we have full knowledge about
every single syntax node. Put your cursor on top of the `func`  keyword or
anywhere below or above (doesn't matter). If you now execute `vaf`, you'll see
that the function declaration is being selected, along with the doc comment as
well! You can for example delete the whole function with `daf`, and you'll see
that the comment is gone as well. Go ahead and put your cursor on top of the
comment and execute `vif` and then `vaf`. You'll see that it selects the
function body, even though your cursor is outside the function, or it selects
the function comments as well.

This is really powerful and this all is thanks to the knowledge we have from
let g:go_textobj_include_function_doc = 1 `motion`. If you don't like comments
being a part of the function declaration, you can easily disable it with:

```vim
let g:go_textobj_include_function_doc = 0
```

If you are interested in learning more about `motion`, check out the blog post I wrote for
more details: [Treating Go types as objects in vim](https://medium.com/@farslan/treating-go-types-as-objects-in-vim-ed6b3fad9287#.45q2rtqgf)

(Optional question: without looking at the `go/ast` package, is the doc comment
a part of the function declaration or not?)

### Struct split and join
There is a great plugin that allows you to split or join Go structs. It's
actually not a Go plugin, but it has support for Go structs. To enable it add
plugin directive between the `plug` definition into your `vimrc` and run
`:PlugInstall`. Example:

```vim
call plug#begin()
Plug 'fatih/vim-go'
Plug 'AndrewRadev/splitjoin.vim'
call plug#end()
```

Once you have installed the plugin, change the `main.go` file to:

```go
package main

type Foo struct {
	Name    string
	Ports   []int
	Enabled bool
}

func main() {
	foo := Foo{Name: "gopher", Ports: []int{80, 443}, Enabled: true}
}
```

Put your cursor on the same line as the struct expression. Now type `gS`. This
will `split` the struct expression into multiple lines. And you can even
reverse it. If your cursor is still on the `foo` variable, execute `gJ` in
`normal` mode. You'll see that the field definitions are all joined.

This doesn't use any AST-aware tools, so for example if you type `gJ` on top of
the fields, you'll see that only two files are joined.

### Snippets

Vim-go supports two popular snippet plugins.
[Ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) and
[neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim). By default, 
if you have `Ultisnips` installed it'll work.  Let us install `ultisnips`
first. Add it between the `plug` directives in your `vimrc` and then run
`:PlugInstall`. Example:

```vim
call plug#begin()
Plug 'fatih/vim-go'
Plug 'SirVer/ultisnips'
call plug#end()
```

There are many helpful snippets. To see the full list check our current
snippets:
https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/blob/master/gosnippets/UltiSnips/go.snippets

Let me show some of the snippets that I'm using the most. Change your `main.go`
content to:

```go
package main

import "encoding/json"

type foo struct {
	Message    string
	Ports      []int
	ServerName string
}

func newFoo() (*foo, error) {
	return &foo{
		Message:  "foo",
		Ports: []int{80},
		ServerName: "Foo",
	}, nil
}

func main() {
	res, err := newFoo()

	out, err := json.Marshal(res)
}
```

Let's put our cursor just after the `newFoo()` expression. Let's panic here if
the err is non-nil. Type `errp` in insert mode and just hit `tab`. You'll see
that it'll be expanded and put your cursor inside the `panic()`` function:

```
if err != nil {
    panic( )
          ^
          cursor position
}
```

Fill the panic with `err` and move on to the `json.Marshal` statement. Do the
same for it.

Now let us print the variable `out`. Because variable printing is so popular,
we have several snippets for it:

```
fn -> fmt.Println()
ff -> fmt.Printf()
ln -> log.Println()
lf -> log.Printf()
```

Here `ff` and `lf` are special. They dynamically copy the variable name into
the format string as well. Try it youself. Move your cursor to the end of the
main function and type `ff` and hit tab. After expanding the snippet you can
start typing. Type `string(out)` and you'll see that both the format string and
the variadic arguments will be filled with the same string you have typed.

This comes very handy to quickly print variables for debugging.
Run your file with `:GoRun` and you should see the following output:

```
string(out) = {"Message":"foo loves bar","Ports":[80],"ServerName":"Foo"}
```

Great. Now let me show one last snippet that I think is very useful. As you see
from the output the fields `Message` and `Ports` begin with uppercase
characters. To fix it we can add a json tag to the struct field. vim-go makes it
very easy to add field tags. Move your cursor to the end of the `Message`
string line in the field:

```
type foo struct {
    Message string .
                   ^ put your cursor here 
}
```

In `insert` mode, type `json` and hit tab. You'll see that it'll be
automatically expanded to valid field tag. The field name is converted
automatically to a lowercase and put there for you. You should now see the
following:

```
type foo struct {
	Message  string `json:"message"`
}
```

It's really amazing. But we can do even better! Go ahead and create a
snippet expansion for the `ServerName` field. You'll see that it's converted to
`server_name`. Amazing right?

```go
type foo struct {
	Message    string `json:"message"`
	Ports      []int
	ServerName string `json:"server_name"`
}
```

### vimrc improvements

* Don't forget to change `gofmt` to `goimports`

```vim
let g:go_fmt_command = "goimports"
```

* When you save your file, `gofmt` shows any errors during parsing the file. If
  there are any parse errors it'll show them inside a quickfix list. This is
  enabled by default. Some people don't like it. To disable it add:

```vim
let g:go_fmt_fail_silently = 1
```

* You can change which case it should apply while converting. By default vim-go
  uses `snake_case`. But you can also use `camelCase` if you wish. For example
  if you wish to change the default value to camel case use the following
  setting:

```vim 
let g:go_snippet_case_type = "camelcase"
```

# Beautify it

By default we only have a limited syntax highlighting enabled. There are two
main reasons. First is that people don't like too much color because it causes
too much distraction. The second reason is that it impacts
the performance of Vim a lot. We need to enable it explicitly. First add the
following settings to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:go_highlight_types = 1
```

This highlights the `bar` and `foo` below:

```
type foo struct{
  quz string
}

type bar interface{}
```

Adding the following:

```vim
let g:go_highlight_fields = 1
```

Will highlight the `quz` below:

```go
type foo struct{
  quz string
}


f := foo{quz:"QUZ"}
f.quz # quz here will be highlighted
```

If we add the following:

```vim
let g:go_highlight_functions = 1
let g:go_highlight_methods = 1
```

We are now also highlighting function names. `Foo` and `main` will now
be highlighted:

```go
func (t *T) Foo() {}

func main() {
}
```

If you add `let g:go_highlight_operators = 1` it will highlight the following
operators such as:

```
- + % < > ! & | ^ * =
-= += %= <= >= != &= |= ^= *= ==
<< >> &^
<<= >>= &^=
:= && || <- ++ --
```

If you add `let g:go_highlight_extra_types = 1` the following extra types
will be highlighted as well:

```
bytes.(Buffer)
io.(Reader|ReadSeeker|ReadWriter|ReadCloser|ReadWriteCloser|Writer|WriteCloser|Seeker)
reflect.(Kind|Type|Value)
unsafe.Pointer
```

Let's move on to more useful highlights. What about build tags? It's not easy
to implement it without looking into the `go/build` document. Let us first add
the following: `let g:go_highlight_build_constraints = 1` and change your
`main.go` file to:

```
// build linux
package main
```

You'll see that it's gray, thus it's not valid. Prepend `+` to the `build` word and save it again:

```
// +build linux
package main
```

Do you know why? If you read the `go/build` package you'll see that the
following is buried in the document:

> ... preceded only by blank lines and other line comments.

Let us change our content again and save it to:


```
// +build linux

package main
```

You'll see that it automatically highlighted it in a valid way. It's really
great. If you go and change `linux` to something you'll see that it also checks
for valid official tags (such as `darwin`,`race`, `ignore`, etc... )


Another similar feature is to highlight the Go directive `//go:generate`. If
you put `let g:go_highlight_generate_tags = 1` into your vimrc, it'll highlight
a valid directive that is processed with the `go generate` command.

We have a lot more highlight settings, these are just a sneak peek of it. For
more check out the settings via `:help go-settings`


### vimrc improvements

* Some people don't like how the tabs are shown. By default Vim shows `8`
  spaces for a single tab. However it's up to us how to represent in Vim. The
  following will change it to show a single tab as 4 spaces:

```
autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.go setlocal noexpandtab tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 
```

This setting will not expand a tab into spaces. It'll show a single tab as `4`
spaces. It will use `4` spaces to represent a single indent.

* A lot of people ask for my colorscheme. I'm using a slightly modified
`molokai`. To enable it add the Plug directive just between the plug
definitions:

```vim
call plug#begin()
Plug 'fatih/vim-go'
Plug 'fatih/molokai'
call plug#end()
```

Also add the following to enable molokai with original color scheme and 256
color version:

```vim
let g:rehash256 = 1
let g:molokai_original = 1
colorscheme molokai
```

After that restart Vim and call `:PlugInstall`. This will pull the plugin
and install it for you. After the plugin is installed, you need to restart Vim
again.

# Check it

From the previous examples you saw that we had many commands that would show
the quickfix window when there was an issue. For example `:GoBuild` shows
errors from the compile output (if any). Or for example `:GoFmt` shows the
parse errors of the current file while formatting it.

We have many other commands that allows us to call and then collect errors,
warnings or suggestions.

For example `:GoLint`. Under the hood it calls `golint`, which is a command
that suggests changes to make Go code more idiomatic. There
is also `:GoVet`, which calls `go vet` under the hood. There are many other
tools that check certain things. To make it easier, someone decided to
create a tool that calls all these checkers. This tool is called
`gometalinter`. And vim-go supports it via the command `:GoMetaLinter`. So what
does it do?

If you just call `:GoMetaLinter` for a given Go source code. By default it'll run
`go vet`, `golint` and `errcheck` concurrently. `gometalinter` collects
all the outputs and normalizes it to a common format. Thus if you call
`:GoMetaLinter`, vim-go shows the result of all these checkers inside a
quickfix list. You can then jump easily between the lint, vet and errcheck
results. The setting for this default is as following:

```vim
let g:go_metalinter_enabled = ['vet', 'golint', 'errcheck']
```

There are many other tools and you can easily customize this list yourself. If
you call `:GoMetaLinter` it'll automatically uses the list above.


Because `:GoMetaLinter` is usually fast, vim-go also can call it whenever you
save a file (just like `:GoFmt`). To enable it you need to add the following to
your `.vimrc:`

```vim
let g:go_metalinter_autosave = 1
```

What's great is that the checkers for the autosave is different than what you
would use for `:GoMetaLinter`.  This is great because you can customize it so only
fast checkers are called when you save your file, but others if you call
`:GoMetaLinter`. The following setting let you customize the checkers for the
`autosave` feature.


```vim
let g:go_metalinter_autosave_enabled = ['vet', 'golint']
```

As you see by default `vet` and `golint` are enabled. Lastly, to prevent
`:GoMetaLinter` running for too long, we have a setting to cancel it after a
given timeout. By default it is `5 seconds` but can be changed by the following
setting:

```vim
let g:go_metalinter_deadline = "5s"
```

# Navigate it

So far we have only jumped between two files, `main.go` and `main_test.go`. It's
really easy to switch if you have just two files in the same directory. But
what if the project gets larger and larger with time? Or what if the file
itself is so large that you have hard time navigating it?


### Alternate files

vim-go has several ways of improving navigation. First let me
show how we can quickly jump between a Go source code and its test file.

Suppose you have both a `foo.go` and its equivalent test file `foo_test.go`.
If you have `main.go` from the previous examples with its test file you can
also open it. Once you open it just execute the following Vim command:

```vim
:GoAlternate
```

You'll see that you switched immediately to `main_test.go`. If you execute it
again, it'll switch to `main.go`. `:GoAlternate` works as a toggle and is
really useful if you have a package with many test files.  The idea is very
similar to the plugin [a.vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/a.vim) command
names. This plugin jumps between a `.c` and `.h` file. In our case
`:GoAlternate` is used to switch between a test and non-test file.

### Go to definition

One of the most used features is `go to definition`. vim-go had from the
beginning the command `:GoDef` that jumps to any identifier's declaration. Let
us first create a `main.go` file to show it in action. Create it with the
following content:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type T struct {
	Foo string
}

func main() {
	t := T{
		Foo: "foo",
	}

	fmt.Printf("t = %+v\n", t)
}
```

Now we have here several ways of jumping to declarations. For example if you put
your cursor on top of `T` expression just after the main function and call
`:GoDef` it'll jump to the type declaration.

If you put your cursor on top of the `t` variable declaration just after the
main function and call `:GoDef`, you'll see that nothing will happen. Because
there is no place to go, but if you scroll down a few lines and put your cursor
to the `t` variable used in `fmt.Printf()` and call `:GoDef`, you'll see that
it jumped to the variable declaration.

`:GoDef` not only works for local scope, it works also globally
(across`GOPATH`).  If, for example, you put your cursor on top of the `Printf()`
function and call `:GoDef`, it'll jump directly to the `fmt` package.  Because
this is used so frequently, vim-go overrides the built in Vim shortcuts `gd`
and `ctrl-]` as well. So instead of `:GoDef` you can easily use `gd` or
`ctrl-]`

Once we jump to a declaration, we also might want to get back into our previous
location. By default there is the Vim shortcut  `ctrl-o` that jumps to the
previous cursor location. It works great when it does, but not good enough if
you're navigating between Go declarations. If, for example, you jump to a file
with `:GoDef` and then scroll down to the bottom, and then maybe to the top,
`ctrl-o` will remember these locations as well. So if you want to jump back to
the previous location when invoking `:GoDef`, you have to hit `ctrl-o` multiple
times. And this is really annoying.

We don't need to use this shortcut though, as vim-go has a better implementation
for you. There is a command `:GoDefPop` which does exactly this. vim-go
keeps an internal stack list for all the locations you visit with `:GoDef`.
This means you can jump back easily again via `:GoDefPop` to your older
locations, and it works even if you scroll down/up in a file. And because this
is also used so many times we have the shortcut `ctrl-t` which calls under the
hood `:GoDefPop`. So to recap:

* Use `ctrl-]` or `gd` to jump to a definition, locally or globally
* Use `ctrl-t` to jump back to the previous location 

Let us move on with another question, suppose you jump so far that you just
want to back to where you started? As mentioned earlier,
vim-go keeps an history of all your locations invoked via `:GoDef`. There is a
command that shows all these and it's called `:GoDefStack`. If you call it,
you'll see that a custom window with a list of your old locations will be
shown. Just navigate to your desired location and hit enter.  And finally to
clear the stack list anytime call `:GoDefStackClear`.


### Move between functions

From the previous example that `:GoDef` is nice if you know where you want to
jump. But what if you don't know what your next destination is? Or you just
partially know the name of a function? 

In our `Edit it` section I mentioned a tool called `motion`, which is a
custom built tool just for vim-go. `motion` has other capabilities as well.
`motion` parses your Go package and thus has a great understanding of all
declarations. We can take advantage of this feature for jumping between
declarations. There are two commands, which are not available until you install
a certain plugin. The commands are:

```
:GoDecls
:GoDeclsDir
```

First let us enable these two commands by installing the necessary plugin. The
plugin is called [ctrlp](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim). Long-time Vim
users have it installed already. To install it add the following line between
your `plug` directives and call `:PlugInstall` to install it:

```vim
Plug 'ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim'
```

Once you have it installed, use the following `main.go` content:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type T struct {
	Foo string
}

func main() {
	t := T{
		Foo: "foo",
	}

	fmt.Printf("t = %+v\n", t)
}

func Bar() string {
	return "bar"
}

func BarFoo() string {
	return "bar_foo"
}
```

And a `main_test.go` file with the following content:

```go
package main

import (
	"testing"
)

type files interface{}

func TestBar(t *testing.T) {
	result := Bar()
	if result != "bar" {
		t.Errorf("expecting bar, got %s", result)
	}
}

func TestQuz(t *testing.T) {
	result := Qux("bar")
	if result != "bar" {
		t.Errorf("expecting bar, got %s", result)
	}

	result = Qux("qux")
	if result != "INVALID" {
		t.Errorf("expecting INVALID, got %s", result)
	}
}
```

Open `main.go` and call `:GoDecls`. You'll see that `:GoDecls` shows all type
and function declarations for you. If you type `ma` you'll see that `ctrlp`
filters the list for you. If you hit `enter` it will automatically jump to it.
The fuzzy search capabilities combined with `motion`'s AST capabilities brings
us a very simple to use but powerful feature.

For example, call `:GoDecls` and write `foo`. You'll see that it'll filter
`BarFoo` for you. The Go parser is very fast and works very well with large files
with hundreds of declarations.

Sometimes just searching within the current file is not enough. A Go package can
have multiple files (such as tests). A type declaration can be in one file,
whereas a some functions specific to a certain set of features can be in
another file. This is where `:GoDeclsDir` is useful. It parses the whole
directory for the given file and lists all the declarations from the files in the 
given directory (but not subdirectories).

Call `:GoDeclsDir`. You'll see this time it also included the declarations from
the `main_test.go` file as well. If you type `Bar`, you'll see both the `Bar`
and `TestBar` functions. This is really great if you just want to get an
overview of all type and function declarations, and also jump to them.

Let's continue with a question. What if you just want to move to the next or
previous function? If you current function body is long, you'll probably will
not see the function names. Or maybe there are other declarations between the
current and other functions.

Vim already has motion operators like `w` for words or `b` for backwards words.
But what if we could add motions for Go ast? For example for function declarations?

vim-go provides(overrides) two motion objects to move between functions. These
are:


```
]] -> jump to next function
[[ -> jump to previous function
```

Vim has these shortcuts by default. But those are suited for C source code and
jumps between braces. We can do it better. Just like our previous example,
`motion` is used under the hood for this operation

Open `main.go` and move to the top of the file. In `normal` mode, type `]]` and
see what happens. You'll see that you jumped to the `main()` function. Another
`]]` will jump to `Bar()` If you hit `[[` it'll jump back to the `main()`
function.

`]]` and `[[` also accepts `counts`. For example if you move to the top again
and hit `3]]` you'll see that it'll jump the third function in the source file.
And going forward, because these are valid motions, you can apply operators to
it as well!

If you move your file to the top  and hit `d]]` you'll see that it deleted
anything before the next function. For example one useful usage would be typing
`v]]` and then hit `]]` again to select the next function, until you've done
with your selection.


### .vimrc improvements

* We can improve it to control how it opens the alternate file. Add the
  following to your `.vimrc`:


```vim
autocmd Filetype go command! -bang A call go#alternate#Switch(<bang>0, 'edit')
autocmd Filetype go command! -bang AV call go#alternate#Switch(<bang>0, 'vsplit')
autocmd Filetype go command! -bang AS call go#alternate#Switch(<bang>0, 'split')
autocmd Filetype go command! -bang AT call go#alternate#Switch(<bang>0, 'tabe')
```

This will add new commands, called `:A`, `:AV`, `:AS` and `:AT`. Here `:A`
works just like `:GoAlternate`, it replaces the current buffer with the
alternate file. `:AV` will open a new vertical split with the alternate file.
`:AS` will open the alternate file in a new split view and `:AT` in a new tab.
These commands are very productive depending on how you use them, so I think
it's useful to have them.

* The "go to definition" command families are very powerful but yet easy to use.
Under the hood it uses by default the tool `guru` (formerly `oracle`). `guru` has
an excellent track of being very predictable. It works for dot imports,
vendorized imports and many other non-obvious identifiers. But sometimes it's
very slow for certain queries. Previously vim-go was using `godef` which is
very fast on resolving queries. With the latest release one can easily use or
switch the underlying tool for `:GoDef`.  To change it back to `godef` use the
following setting:

```vim
let g:go_def_mode = 'godef'
```

* Currently by default `:GoDecls` and `:GoDeclsDir` shows type and function
  declarations. This is customizable with the `g:go_decls_includes` setting. By
  default it's in the form of:

```
let g:go_decls_includes = "func,type"
```

If you just want to show function declarations, change it to:

```
let g:go_decls_includes = "func"
```

# Understand it

Writing/editing/changing code is usually something we can do only if we first
understand what the code is doing. vim-go has several ways to make it easy to
understand what your code is all about. 

### Documentation lookup

Let's start with the basics. Go documentation is very well-written and is
highly integrated into the Go AST as well. If you just write some comments, the
parser can easily parse it and associate with any node in the AST. So what it
means is that, we can easily find the documentation in the reverse order. If
you have the node from an AST, you can easily read the documentation (if you
have it)!

We have a command called `:GoDoc` that shows any documentation associated with
the identifier under your cursor. Let us change the content of `main.go` to:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("vim-go")
	fmt.Println(sayHi())
	fmt.Println(sayYoo())
}

// sayHi() returns the string "hi"
func sayHi() string {
	return "hi"
}

func sayYoo() string {
	return "yoo"
}
```

Put your cursor on top of the `Println` function just after the `main` function
and call `:GoDoc`. You'll see that it vim-go automatically opens a scratch
window that shows the documentation for you:

```
import "fmt"

func Println(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)

Println formats using the default formats for its operands and writes to
standard output. Spaces are always added between operands and a newline is
appended. It returns the number of bytes written and any write error
encountered.
```

It shows the import path, the function signature and then finally the doc
comment of the identifier. Initially vim-go was using plain `go doc`, but it
has some shortcomings, such as not resolving based on a byte identifier. `go
doc` is great for terminal usages, but it's hard to integrate into editors.
Fortunately we have a very useful tool called `gogetdoc`, which resolves and
retrieves the AST node for the underlying node and outputs the associated doc
comment.

That's why `:GoDoc` works for any kind of identifier. If your put your cursor under
`sayHi()` and call `:GoDoc` you'll see that it shows it as well. And if you put
it under `sayYoo()` you'll see that it just outputs `no documentation` for AST
nodes without doc comments.

As usual with other features, we override the default normal shortcut `K` so
that it invokes `:GoDoc` instead of `man` (or something else). It's really easy
to find the documentation, just hit `K` in normal mode!

`:GoDoc` just shows the documentation for a given identifier. But it's not a
**documentation explorer**, if you want to explore the documentation there is
third-party plugin that does it:
[go-explorer](https://github.com/garyburd/go-explorer). There is a open bug to
include it into vim-go.

### Identifier resolution

Sometimes you want to know what a function is accepting or returning. Or what
the identifier under your cursor is. Questions like this are common and we have
a command to answer it.

Using the same `main.go` file, go over the `Println` function and call
`:GoInfo`. You'll see that the function signature is being printed in the
statusline. This is really great to see what it's doing, as you don't have to
jump to the definition and check out what the signature is. 

But calling `:GoInfo` every time is tedious. We can make some improvements to
call it faster. As always a way of making it faster is to add a shortcut:

```vim
autocmd FileType go nmap <Leader>i <Plug>(go-info)
```

Now you easily call `:GoInfo` by just hitting `<leader>i`. But there is still
room to improve it. vim-go has a support to automatically show the information
whenever you move your cursor. To enable it add the following to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:go_auto_type_info = 1
```

Now whenever you move your cursor onto a valid identifier, you'll see that your
status line is updated automatically. By default it updates every `800ms`. This
is a vim setting and can be changed with the `updatetime` setting. To change it
to `100ms` add the following to your `.vimrc`

```vim
set updatetime=100
```

### Identifier highlighting

Sometimes we just want to quickly see all matching identifiers. Such as variables,
functions, etc.. Suppose you have the following Go code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("vim-go")
	err := sayHi()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}

// sayHi() returns the string "hi"
func sayHi() error {
	fmt.Println("hi")
	return nil
}
```

If you put your cursor on top of `err` and call `:GoSameIds` you'll see that
all the `err` variables get highlighted. Put your cursor on the `sayHi()`
function call, and you'll see that the `sayHi()` function identifiers all are
highlighted. To clear them just call `:GoSameIdsClear`

This is more useful if we don't have to call it manually every time. vim-go
can automatically highlight matching identifiers. Add the following to your
`vimrc`:

```vim
let g:go_auto_sameids = 1
```

After restarting your virmc, you'll see that you don't need to call
`:GoSameIds` manually anymore. Matching identifier variables are now highlighted
automatically for you.

### Dependencies and files

As you know a package can be consist of multiple dependencies and files. Even
if you have many files inside the directory, only the files that have the
package clause correctly are part of a package.

To see the files that makes a package you can call the following:

```
:GoFiles
```

which will output (my `$GOPATH` is set to `~/Code/Go`):

```
['/Users/fatih/Code/go/src/github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial/main.go']
```

If you have other files those will be listed as well. Note that this command is
only for listing Go files that are part of the build. Test files will be not
listed. 

For showing the dependencies of a file you can call `:GoDeps`. If you call  it
you'll see:

```
['errors', 'fmt', 'internal/race', 'io', 'math', 'os', 'reflect', 'runtime',
'runtime/internal/atomic', 'runtime/internal/sys', 'strconv', 'sync',
'sync/atomic ', 'syscall', 'time', 'unicode/utf8', 'unsafe']
```

### Guru

The previous feature was using the tool `guru` under the hood. So let's talk a
little bit about guru. So what is guru? Guru is an editor integrated tool for
navigating and understanding Go code. There is a user manual that shows all the
features: [https://golang.org/s/using-guru](https://golang.org/s/using-guru)

---

Let us use the same examples from that manual to show some of the features we've
integrated into vim-go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	h := make(handler)
	go counter(h)
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8000", h); err != nil {
		log.Print(err)
	}
}

func counter(ch chan<- int) {
	for n := 0; ; n++ {
		ch <- n
	}
}

type handler chan int

func (h handler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	w.Header().Set("Content-type", "text/plain")
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "%s: you are visitor #%d", req.URL, <-h)
}
```

Put your cursor on top of the `handler` and call `:GoReferrers`. This calls the
`referrers` mode of `vim-go`, which finds references to the selected identifier,
scanning all necessary packages within the workspace. The result will be a
quickfix list, so you should be able to jump to the results easily.

---

One of the modes of `guru` is also the `describe` mode. It's just like
`:GoInfo`, but it's a little bit more advanced (it gives us more information).
It shows for example the method set of a type if there is any. It shows the
declarations of a package if selected.

Let's continue with same `main.go` file.  Put the cursor on top of the `URL`
field or `req.URL` (inside `ServeHTTP` function). Call `:GoDescribe`.  You'll
see a quick fix list populated with the following content:

```
main.go|27 col 48| reference to field URL *net/url.URL
/usr/local/go/src/net/http/request.go|91 col 2| defined here
main.go|27 col 48| Methods:
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|587 col 15| method (*URL) EscapedPath() string
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|844 col 15| method (*URL) IsAbs() bool
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|851 col 15| method (*URL) Parse(ref string) (*URL, error)
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|897 col 15| method (*URL) Query() Values
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|904 col 15| method (*URL) RequestURI() string
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|865 col 15| method (*URL) ResolveReference(ref *URL) *URL
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|662 col 15| method (*URL) String() string
main.go|27 col 48| Fields:
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|310 col 2| Scheme   string
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|311 col 2| Opaque   string
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|312 col 2| User     *Userinfo
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|313 col 2| Host     string
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|314 col 2| Path     string
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|315 col 2| RawPath  string
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|316 col 2| RawQuery string
/usr/local/go/src/net/url/url.go|317 col 2| Fragment string
```

You'll see that we can see the definition of the field, the method set and the
`URL` struct's fields. This is a very useful command and it's there if you need
it and want to understand the surrounding code. Try and experiment by calling
`:GoDescribe` on various other identifiers to see what the output is.

---

One of the most asked questions is how to know the interfaces a type is
implementing. Suppose you have a type and with a method set of several methods.
You want to know which interface it might implement. The mode `implement` of
`guru` just does it and it helps to find the interface a type implements.

Just continue with the same previous `main.go` file. Put your cursor on the
`handler` identifier just after the `main()` function. Call `:GoImplements`
You'll see a quick fix list populated with the following content:


```
main.go|23 col 6| chan type handler
/usr/local/go/src/net/http/server.go|57 col 6| implements net/http.Handler
```

The first line is our selected type and the second line will be the interface
it implements. Because a type can implement many interfaces it's a quickfix
list that you can navigate.

---

One of the `guru` modes that might be helpful is `whicherrs`. As you know
errors are just values. So they can be programmed and thus can represent any
type. See what the `guru` manual says:

> The whicherrs mode reports the set of possible constants, global variables,
> and concrete types that may appear in a value of type error. This information
> may be useful when handling errors to ensure all the important cases have
> been dealt with.

So how do we use it? It's easy. We still use the same `main.go` file. Put your
cursor on top of `err` identifier which is returned from `http.ListenAndServe`.
Call `:GoWhicherrs`, you'll see the following output:

```
main.go|12 col 6| this error may contain these constants:
/usr/local/go/src/syscall/zerrors_darwin_amd64.go|1171 col 2| syscall.EINVAL
main.go|12 col 6| this error may contain these dynamic types:
/usr/local/go/src/syscall/syscall_unix.go|100 col 6| syscall.Errno
/usr/local/go/src/net/net.go|380 col 6| *net.OpError
```

This is a classic `quickfix` output and you can navigate between them. You'll
see that the `err` value may be the `syscall.EINVAL` constant or it also might
be the dynamic types `syscall.Errno` or `*net.OpError`. As you see this is
really helpful to implement custom logic to handle the error differently if
needed. Note that this query needs a guru `scope` to be set. We'll going to
cover in a moment what a `scope` is and how you can change it dynamically.

---

Let's continue with the same `main.go` file.  Go is famous for it's concurrency
primitives, such as channels. Tracking how values are send between channels can
get sometimes hard. To understand it better we have the `peers` mode of `guru`.
This query shows the set of possible send/receives on the channel operand(send
or receive operation).

Move your cursor to the following expression and select the whole line:

```go
ch <- n
```

Call `:GoChannelPeers`. You'll see a quickfix window with the following content:

```
main.go|19 col 6| This channel of type chan<- int may be:
main.go|10 col 11| allocated here
main.go|19 col 6| sent to, here
main.go|27 col 53| received from, here
```

As you see you can see the allocation of the channel, where it's sending and
receiving from. Because this uses pointer analysis, you have to define a scope.

---


Let us see how function calls and targets are related. This time create the
following files. The content of `main.go` should be:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial/example"
)

func main() {
	Hello(example.GopherCon)
	Hello(example.Kenya)
}

func Hello(fn func() string) {
	fmt.Println("Hello " + fn())
}
```

And the file should be under `example/example.go`:

```go
package example

func GopherCon() string {
	return "GopherCon"
}

func Kenya() string {
	return "Kenya"
}
```

So jump to the `Hello` function inside `main.go` and put your cursor on top of
the function call named `fn()`. Execute `:GoCallees`. This command shows the
possible call targets of the selected function call. As you see it'll show us
the function declarations inside the `example` function. Those functions are
the callees, because they were called by the function call named `fn()`.

Jump back to `main.go` again and this time put your cursor on the function
declaration `Hello()`. What if we want to see the callers of this function?
Execute `:GoCallers`.

You should see the output:

```
main.go| 10 col 7 static function call from github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial.Main
main.go| 11 col 7 static function call from github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial.Main
```

As with the other usages you can easily navigate the callers inside the
quickfix window.

Finally there is also the `callstack` mode, which shows an arbitrary path from
the root of the call graph to the function containing the selection.


Put your cursor back to the `fn()` function call inside the `Hello()` function.
Select the function and call `:GoCallStack`. The output should be like
(simplified form):

```
main.go| 15 col 26 Found a call path from root to (...)Hello
main.go| 14 col 5 (...)Hello
main.go| 10 col 7 (...)main
```
It starts from line `15`, and then to line `14` and then ends at line `10`.
This is the graph from the root (which starts from `main()`) to the function we
selected (in our case `fn()`)

---

For most of the `guru` commands you don't need any scope to define. What is a
`scope`? The following excerpt is straight from the `guru`
[manual](http://golang.org/s/using-guru):


> Pointer analysis scope: some queries involve pointer analysis, a technique for
> answering questions of the form “what might this pointer point to?”.  It is
> usually too expensive to run pointer analysis over all the packages in the
> workspace, so these queries require an additional configuration parameter
> called the scope, which determines the set of packages to analyze.  Set the
> scope to the application (or set of applications---a client and server,
> perhaps) on which you are currently working.  Pointer analysis is a
> whole-program analysis, so the only packages in the scope that matter are the
> main and test packages.
> 
> The scope is typically specified as a comma-separated set of packages, or
> wildcarded subtrees like github.com/my/dir/...; consult the specific
> documentation for your editor to find out how to set and vary the scope.


`vim-go` automatically tries to be smart and sets the current packages import
path as the `scope` for you. If the command needs a scope, you're mostly
covered. Most of the times this is enough, but for some queries you might to
change the scope setting. To make it easy to change the `scope` on the fly with
have a specific setting called `:GoGuruScope`

If you call it, it'll return an error: `guru scope is not set`. Let us change
it explicitly to the `github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial" scope: 

```
:GoGuruScope github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial
```

You should see the message:

```
guru scope changed to: github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial
```

If you run `:GoGuruScope` without any arguments, it'll output the following

```
current guru scope: github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial
```

To select the whole `GOPATH` you can use the `...` argument:

```
:GoGuruScope ...
```

You can also define multiple packages and also subdirectories. The following
example selects all packages under `github.com` and the `golang.org/x/tools`
package:

```
:GoGuruScope github.com/... golang.org/x/tools
```

You can exclude packages by prepending the `-` (negative) sign to a package.
The following example selects all packages under `encoding` but not
`encoding/xml`:

```
:GoGuruScope encoding/... -encoding/xml
```

To clear the scope just pass an empty string:

```
:GoGuruScope ""
```

If you're working on a project where you have to set the scope always to the
same value and you don't want to call `:GoGuruScope` everytime you start Vim,
you can also define a permanent scope by adding a setting to your `vimrc`. The
value needs to be a list of string types. Here are some examples from the
commands above:

```
let g:go_guru_scope = ["github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial"]
let g:go_guru_scope = ["..."]
let g:go_guru_scope = ["github.com/...", "golang.org/x/tools"]
let g:go_guru_scope = ["encoding/...", "-encoding/xml"]
```

Finally, `vim-go` tries to auto complete packages for you while using
`:GoGuruScope` as well. So when you try to write
`github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial` just type `gi` and hit `tab`, you'll see
it'll expand to `github.com`

---

Another setting that you should be aware are build tags  (also called build
constraints). For example the following is a build tag you put in your Go
source code:

```
// +build linux darwin
```

Sometimes there might be custom tags in your source code, such as:

```
// +build mycustomtag
```

In this case, guru will fail as the underlying `go/build` package will be not
able to build the package. So all `guru` related commands will fail (even
`:GoDef` when it uses `guru`). Fortunately `guru` has a `-tags` flag that
allows us to pass custom tags. To make it easy for `vim-go` users we have a
`:GoGuruTags`

For the example just call the following:

```
:GoGuruTags mycustomtag
```

This will pass this tag to `guru` and from now on it'll work as expected. And
just like `:GoGuruScope`, you can clear it with:

```
:GoGuruTags ""
```

And finally if you wish you can make it permanent with the following setting:

```
let g:go_guru_tags = "mycustomtag"
```

# Refactor it

### Rename identifiers

Renaming identifiers is one of the most common tasks. But it's also something
that needs to be done carefully to not break other packages as well. Also just
using a tool like `sed` is sometimes not useful, as you want AST aware
renaming, so it only should rename identifiers that are part of the AST (it
should not rename for example identifiers in other non Go files, say build
scripts)

There is a tool that does renaming for you, which is called `gorename`.
`vim-go` uses the `:GoRename` command to use `gorename` under the hood.  Let us
change `main.go` to the following content:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Server struct {
	name string
}

func main() {
	s := Server{name: "Alper"}
	fmt.Println(s.name) // print the server name
}

func name() string {
	return "Zeynep"
}
```

Put your cursor on top of the `name` field inside the `Server` struct and call
`:GoRename bar`.  You'll see all `name` references are renamed to `bar`. The
final final content would look like:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Server struct {
	bar string
}

func main() {
	s := Server{bar: "Alper"}
	fmt.Println(s.bar) // print the server name
}

func name() string {
	return "Zeynep"
}
```

As you see only the necessary identifiers are renamed. But the function `name`
or the string inside the comment is not renamed. What even better is that
`:GoRename` sarches all packages under `GOPATH` and renames all identifiers
that depends on the identifier. It's a very powerful tool.

### Extract function

Let's move to another example. Change your `main.go` file to:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	msg := "Greetings\nfrom\nTurkey\n"

	var count int
	for i := 0; i < len(msg); i++ {
		if msg[i] == '\n' {
			count++
		}
	}

	fmt.Println(count)
}
```

This is a basic example that just counts the newlines in our `msg` variable. If
you run it, you'll see that it outputs `3`. 

Assume we want to reuse the newline counting logic somewhere else. Let us
refactor it. Guru can help us in these situations with the `freevars` mode. The
`freevars` mode shows variables that are referenced but not defined within a
given selection. 

Let us select the piece in `visual` mode:

```go
var count int
for i := 0; i < len(msg); i++ {
	if msg[i] == '\n' {
		count++
	}
}
```

After selecting it, call `:GoFreevars`. It should be in form of
`:'<,'>GoFreevars`. The result is again a quickfix list and it contains all the
variables that free variables. In our case it's a single variable and the
result is:


```go
var msg string
```

So how useful is this? This little piece of information is enough to refactor
it into a standalone function. Create a new function with the following content:

```go
func countLines(msg string) int {
	var count int
	for i := 0; i < len(msg); i++ {
		if msg[i] == '\n' {
			count++
		}
	}
	return count
}
```

You'll see that the content is our previously selected code. And the input to
the function is the result of `:GoFreevars`, the free variables. We only
decided what to return (if any). In our case we return the count. Our `main.go` will be in the form of:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	msg := "Greetings\nfrom\nTurkey\n"

	count := countLines(msg)
	fmt.Println(count)
}

func countLines(msg string) int {
	var count int
	for i := 0; i < len(msg); i++ {
		if msg[i] == '\n' {
			count++
		}
	}
	return count
}
```

That's how you refactor a piece of code. `:GoFreevars` can be used also to
understand the complexity of a code. Just run it and see how many variables are
dependent to it.

# Generate it

Generation code is a hot topic. Because of the great std libs such as go/ast,
go/parser, go/printer, etc.. Go has the advantage to create great generators
easily. 

First we have the `:GoGenerate` command that calls `go generate` under the
hood. It just works like `:GoBuild`, `:GoTest`, etc.. If there is any errors it
also shows them so you can easily fix it.

### Method stubs implementing an interface

Interfaces are really great for composition. It makes you code easier to deal
with it. It's also easier for you to create tests as you can mock functions who
accept an interface type with a type that implements method for testing.


`vim-go` has support for the tool [impl](https://github.com/josharian/impl).
`impl` generates method stubs that implements a given interface. Let us change
`main.go`'s content to the following:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type T struct{}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("vim-go")
}
```

Put your cursor on top of `T` and type `:GoImpl`. You'll be prompted to write
an interface. Type `io.ReadWriteCloser` and hit enter. You'll see the content
changed to:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type T struct{}

func (t *T) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
	panic("not implemented")
}

func (t *T) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
	panic("not implemented")
}

func (t *T) Close() error {
	panic("not implemented")
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("vim-go")
}
```

That's really neat as you see. You can also just type `:GoImpl
io.ReadWriteCloser` when your on top of a type and it'll do the same. 

But you don't need to put your cursor on top of a type.  You can invoke it from
everywhere. For example execute this:

```
:GoImpl b *B io.Stringer
```

You'll see the following will be created:

```go
func (b *B) String() string {
	panic("not implemented")
}
```

As you see this is very helpful, especially if you have a large interface with
large method set. You can easily generate it, and because it uses `panic()`
this compiles without any problem. Just fill the necessary parts and you're
done.

# Share it

`vim-go` has also features to easily share your code with other via
https://play.golang.org/. As you know the Go playground is a perfect place to
share small snippets, exercises or and tips&tricks. There are times you are
playing with an idea and want to share with others. You copy the code and visit
play.golang.org and then paste it.  `vim-go` makes all these better with the
`:GoPlay` command.

First let us change our `main.go` file with the following simple code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("vim-go")
}
```

Now call `:GoPlay` and hit enter. You'll see that `vim-go` automatically
uploaded your source code `:GoPlay` and also opened a browser tab that shows
it. But there is more. The snippet link is automatically copied to your
clipboard as well. Just paste the link to somewhere. You'll see the link is the
same as what's on play.golang.org.

`:GoPlay` also accepts a range. You can select a piece of code and call
`:GoPlay`. It'll only upload the selected part.

There are two settings to tweak the behavior of `:GoPlay`. If you don't like
that `vim-go` opens a browser tab for you, you can disable it with:

```
let g:go_play_open_browser = 0
```

Secondly, if your browser is misdetected (we're using `open` or `xdg-open`) you
can manually set the browser via:

```
let g:go_play_browser_command = "chrome"
```
